# Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict the price of gold.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a regression model that can accurately predict the price of gold based on historical data and relevant features. We will explore various machine learning algorithms, preprocess the data, and tune hyperparameters to achieve the best possible performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [source_name]. It includes historical data on gold prices along with various features such as economic indicators, market trends, and geopolitical events. The dataset is available in CSV format and is included in the `data` directory.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThejasNarayan/gold-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gold-price-prediction
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to explore the data, train models, and evaluate performance.
3. Alternatively, you can use the Python scripts in the `scripts` directory for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Model Evaluation

We will evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
